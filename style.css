This is a theme that's built on the starter theme Bones by Themble. I love Bones, but found myself making a lot of the same changes at the beginning of every project. Things like making the menu mobile-friendly, tweaking the SASS file structure and organization, and adding custom fields and archive options. Beyond that, this is a bit more ready to roll right out of the box, so folks wouldn't necessarily need to do a lot of customizing to have a decent blog or personal site.
