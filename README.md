# hues-Theme
A responsive Wordpress theme built on Bones. Extensive use of custom fields, 
and relies on isotope.js, sheetrock.js and handlebars.js (for the people directory),
and Font Awesome icons.
    
## Get Started: meet Bones

Bones, the starter theme by Eddie Machado / Themble, is the nuts and bolts of this theme. 
Get to know how Bones runs using their documentation, and you'll have a good sense of how
to tweak this theme to your needs.

## No support, but feel free to use

Like all of the code I create, this theme is unsupported, but yours to use, learn from, or deploy. 
It's a fully-fleshed out design and build with specific goals for the hues site, but the sections,
page templates, use of custom fields, and light use of jquery might be helpful for others to build
upon. 

Have fun.
